## React + Redux: Updated Course Code

This folder contains an updated version of the code from the "Implementing React with Redux" lessons.

### Folder Structure

- **Start** – The initial project setup, as used at the beginning of the course. Includes setup instructions and comments to guide you through building the app step by step.
- **Complete** – A fully built and working version of the application.

### Key Updates

- **Loading bar replacement**: We've removed react-redux-loading-bar. Similar functionality has been implemented manually in the code. You’ll find setup instructions in the Start version.
